# Rhino

This is a small Rack-based Ruby Web Framework.
I created it for **Learning Ruby** and for **Fun**

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
$ gem install rhino-framework
```

create new app:
```
$ rhino new awesome_app
$ cd awesome_app
$ bundle install
$ rackup -p 6789
```
